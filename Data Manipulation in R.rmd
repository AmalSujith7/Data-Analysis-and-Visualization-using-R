## Obtain a data frame called “newsurvey” by removing all ‘na’ values in “survey” data of MASS package to do the following:
```{r}
library(MASS)
data("survey")
newsurvey_unclean <- survey
newsurvey <- na.omit(newsurvey_unclean)
dim(newsurvey)
head(newsurvey)
```



### 1.Install the dplyr package and import it.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```


### 2.Filter the bottom 5 male left handers.	

```{r}
newsurvey %>%
  filter(W.Hnd =="Left",Sex =="Male" ) %>%
  tail(5)
```


### 3.Display all male right handers who keep left on top while clapping.

```{r}
newsurvey %>%
  filter(W.Hnd =="Right",Sex =="Male", Clap=="Right")
```

### 4.Display random 3 students under each category of exercise.

```{r}
newsurvey %>% 
  group_by(Exer) 
  slice_sample(newsurvey, n=3)
```


### 5.Display random 6 rows of gender, age and writing hand columns of the students.

```{r}
newsurvey %>%
  dplyr::select(Sex,Age,W.Hnd)%>%
  sample_n(6)
```

### 6.Display random 50% of the rows of age, pulse rate and writing hand span of male right handers.

```{r}
newsurvey %>%
  filter(W.Hnd =="Right",Sex =="Male")%>%
  dplyr::select(Age,Pulse,Wr.Hnd)%>%
  sample_frac(0.5)
```

### 7.Arrange all female right handers according to descending order of their heights.

```{r}
newsurvey %>%
  filter(W.Hnd =="Right",Sex =="Female")%>%
  arrange(desc(Height))
```

### 8.Introduce a new column hand_span which contains the value as sum of span of writing hand and non-writing hand and display it along with gender, writing hand and non-writing hand span.

```{r}
newsurvey %>%
  mutate(hand_span=Wr.Hnd+NW.Hnd)%>%
  dplyr::select(Sex,W.Hnd,Wr.Hnd,NW.Hnd,hand_span)%>%
  head()
```

### 9.Display the median writing span of male and female left handers.

```{r}
newsurvey %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarize(mn1=median(Wr.Hnd))
```

### 10	Find the minimum pulse rate of male left and right handers.

```{r}
newsurvey %>%
  filter(Sex =="Male")%>%
  group_by(W.Hnd) %>%
  summarize(min_pulse=min(Wr.Hnd))
```




## R Markdown

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
