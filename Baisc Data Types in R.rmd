### 1.Assign a numeric value to a variable ‘a’ and convert ‘a’ into an integer
```{r}
a <- 1.5
as.integer(a)
```


### 2.	Make this quote into an R string– “Do you think this is a game?”, he said. “No, I think Jenga’s a game”, Archer responded.

```{r}
str <- "\"Do you think this is a game?\", he said. \"No, I think Jenga’s a game\", Archer responded."
str
```


### 3.Create two numeric vectors p & q

```{r}
p <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
q <- c(5,6,7,8,9)
print(p)
print(q)
```

### 4.Use R as a calculator to do basic arithmetic operations on p &q and store each result in different variables

```{r}
add <- p+q
sub <- p-q
div <- p/q
mul <- p*q
add
sub
div
mul

```


### 5.Calculate sqrt(a) and perform log2 transformation on the result.

```{r}
b <- sqrt(a)
log2(b)
```

### 6.Calculate the 10-based logarithm of 100 and multiply the result with cosine of π

```{r}
result <- log10(100)
result
answer <- result*cos(pi)
answer
```

### 7.	Create a vector ‘x’ using : operator from -2 to 2.

```{r}
x <- -2:2
x
```

### 8.	Print the dimension and length of x.

```{r}
x <- -2:2
x
length(x)
dim(x)
```

### 9.	Create two vectors small and caps with last 5 alphabets in lower case and first 5 alphabets in upper case respectively. Bind it row and columnwise.

```{r}
y <- c("a","b","c","d","e","A","B","C","D","E")
x <- c("f","g","h","i","j","F","G","H","I","J")
cbind(y,x)
rbind(y,x)
```

### 10.	Create a matrix M=[[1 2 5 ][−4 8 6 ][3 −1 7]] and find MxMxM.

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,5)
b <- c(-4,8,6)
c <- c(3,-1,7)
M <- rbind(a,b,c)
M%*%M%*%M
```

### 11.	Find the result of elementwise multiplication of M by M.

```{r}
M*M
```

### 12.	Find the transpose, inverse and determinant of M.

```{r}
t <- t(M)
t
I <- solve(M)
I
det(M)
```






## R Markdown

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
