## Amal Sujith

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)
data("survey")
newsurvey_unclean <- survey
newsurvey <- na.omit(newsurvey_unclean)
dim(newsurvey)
head(newsurvey)
```




###1.1.	Plot a bar graph for the number of male and female participants in the survey. Provide the title as “Male and Female participants” and specify the colours for the bars.

```{r}
ggplot(newsurvey, aes(x=Sex,fill=Sex,color="red"))+geom_bar() +ggtitle("Male and Female participants")

```


### 2.	Plot a bar graph for the number of left handers and right handers in the survey. Provide the title as “Left Handers and Right Handers” and specify the colours for the bars.
```{r}
ggplot(newsurvey, aes(x=W.Hnd,fill=W.Hnd,color="red"))+geom_bar() +ggtitle("Left Handers and Right handers")
```


### 3.	Plot the distribution between male right handers and female right handers using bar chart. Provide the title as “Female Right Handers and Male Right Handers” and specify the colours for the bars.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
ggplot(newsurvey, aes(x=W.Hnd,fill=W.Hnd,color="red"))+geom_bar() +ggtitle("Female Right Handers and Male Right Handers")
```

### 4.	Draw the distribution of smoking habits of female left handers based on age using pie chart.

```{r}
ggplot(newsurvey, aes(x="",y=mpg,fill=cyl_factor))+geom_bar(width = 1,stat='identity')+coord_polar("y",start = 0)

```
```{r}
table(newsurvey$Smoke)

```

```{r}
freq <- table(newsurvey$Smoke)
freq
```

```{r}

pie(freq,radius=1)
```

### 5.	Draw the histogram of age distribution with the title as ‘Age distribution’ and xlabel as ‘Age range’ and ylabel as ‘frequency’.
```{r}
ggplot(newsurvey,aes(x=Age))+geom_histogram()+labs(title = "Age distribution",y='frequency',x='Age Range')
```

### 6.	Reveal the relationship between the age and writing hand span using scatter plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=newsurvey, mapping=aes(x=Age,y=W.Hnd))+geom_point()
```


### 7	Plot the distribution of writing hand span vs. pulse rate of right handers. Provide colour based on gender and vary the size of the point based on height of the student.
```{r}
summary(newsurvey$Pulse)

```

```{r}
boxplot(newsurvey$Pulse,main="Pulse Rate")
```

###8.	Plot the distribution of height of the students with filled colour based on gender with facet based on left and write handers.
```{r}
summary(newsurvey$Pulse)

```

###9.	Plot the trend of span of writing hand vs. non-writing hand coloured and grouped based on left and right handers with facet label based on exercise.
```{r}
summary(newsurvey$Pulse)

```

### 10.	Plot the distribution of age of students based on categories under clap with facet wrap based on gender.
```{r}
summary(newsurvey$Pulse)

```

### 11.	Plot the box plot of writing hand span with respect to exercise category of students.
```{r}
summary(newsurvey$Pulse)

```







#### Frame any 4 questions on data visualization to graphically depict the data that you have chosen for cleaning.

```{r}
nycdata<- read.csv("AB_NYC_2019.csv")
#dimention of data
dim(nycdata)
```

```{r}
#cleaning the data by omitting na values
sum(is.na(nycdata))
```

```{r}
nyc <- na.omit(nycdata)

sum(is.na(nyc))
```

### 1.	Plot the distribution between room typ in the Manhattan as a neighborhood group using bar chart. Provide y-axis label as “count”

```{r}
unique(nyc$room_type)
```

```{r}
manhattan <- nyc %>%
  filter(neighbourhood_group=="Manhattan") 
par(mar=c(4,4,2,1))
barplot(table(manhattan$room_type), main ="Room Type in Manhattan",ylab="count")

```
#In this output we can observe the frequency of distribution for each of the room type that is rented in Manhattan



### 2.Draw a pie chart for calculated calculated host listings whose frequency is less then 50.

```{r}
unique(nyc$calculated_host_listings_count)


```

```{r}
table(nyc$calculated_host_listings_count)
```

```{r}
freq <- table(nyc$calculated_host_listings_count)
freq
```

```{r}
x <- freq<50
x
```

```{r}
nyc_new<- freq[x]
nyc_new
```

```{r}
table(nyc_new)
```

```{r}
pie(nyc_new,radius=1)
```

#In the output we get is to view pie chart for the calculated host listings whose frequency is below 50



### 3.	Plot the distribution chart for the price spent by the visitor for any room and provide a title as “Price” and “count” as y label

```{r}
par(mar= c(4,4,2,1))
unique(nyc$price)
```

```{r}
barplot(table(nyc$price), ylab= "count", main="Price")
```


#In this output the plot refers to the frequency of the price spent by each visitor and the frequency is highest in the range of 40 to 201 price range.


## R Markdown

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
