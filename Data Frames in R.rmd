## 2a-Creating a data frame


### 1.	Create a data frame by considering 5 students and 4 courses (C1,C2, C3, C4). Each score has a maximum score of 30. If a student is absent for CAT1 of a course, the mark entry is 0 for that course. (Have 0 entry also in the data)
```{r}
my_df <- data.frame(names = c("Zeel","Dhyani","Dan","Isha","Khushi"),
                    c1 = c(20, 22, 25, 29, 15),
                    c2 = c(10, 15, 0, 16, 18),
                    c3 = c(15, 0, 20, 18, 24),
                    c4 = c(23, 14, 0, 30, 29))
my_df

```


###2.	View the contents of the data frame.
```{r}
print(my_df)
```


### 3.	Find the total marks of each student.

```{r}
total <- rowSums(my_df[c(2,3,4,5)])
total
```

### 4.	Append a column to include the total marks of the students and view the data frame
```{r}
my_df$total <- total
my_df

```


### 5.	Find the maximum total marks and display the name of the participant who scored it.

```{r}
max(my_df$total)
my_df$names[which.max(my_df$total)]
```

### 6.	Compute the average mark in each course and append it as a new row in the data frame.
```{r}
my_df <- rbind(my_df,data.frame(names="Avg_Score",c1=mean(my_df$c1),c2=mean(my_df$c2),c3=mean(my_df$c3),c4=mean(my_df$c4),total=mean(my_df$total)))
my_df
```

### 7.	Store the details in a comma separated values (csv) file. Also suppress the row numbers.
```{r}
write.csv(my_df,"courses.csv",row.names = FALSE)
```

### 8.	Read the content of recently stored csv file in a data frame and view it.

```{r}
courses <- read.csv("courses.csv")
str(courses)
courses
```

### 9.	Access the marks of students in C2 using the column name.

```{r}
courses
row_to_keep = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)  #to leave out the average score row 
e2 <-  courses[row_to_keep,]
e2$c2
```

### 10.	Use index number to retrieve the same data.

```{r}
e2[3]
```

### 11.	Extract the marks of third student in C3..

```{r}
courses
courses[3,4]
```

### 12.	Extract the marks of the first and second student in all courses.

```{r}
courses[c(1,2),c(1,2,3,4,5)]
```

### 13.	Display the names and total marks of all students.

```{r}
courses
courses[c(1,6)]
```


### 14.	Make the column “name” as the row index of the data frame.

```{r}
df2= courses[-1]
df2
row.names(df2) <- courses$names
df2
```

### 15.	Display the names of the students who were absent for the course C3 during CAT1.

```{r}
boolv <- courses["c3"]==0

courses$names[boolv]
```

### 16.	Obtain the names whose total marks is below its average.

```{r}
boolv <- courses["total"]>mean(courses[c(1,2,3,4,5),"total"])
courses[c(1,2,3,4,5),"total"]
mean(courses[c(1,2,3,4,5),"total"])
boolv
courses$names[boolv]

```



## Ex-2b Basic Operations in data frame

### 1.	Install the package MASS.

```{r}
library(MASS)
```

### 2.	Import the package MASS.

```{r}
data(survey)
dtframe <-survey
```

### 3.	Display the structure of the data survey.
```{r}
str(dtframe)
```

### 4.	Check the class and type of the data set survey in MASS.

```{r}
class(dtframe)
typeof(dtframe)
```

### 5.	Get the number of rows and columns of the survey data frame.

```{r}
nrow(dtframe)
ncol(dtframe)
```

### 6.	Get the dimension of the survey data frame.

```{r}
dim(dtframe)
```

### 7.	Provide the statistical summary of the data frame.

```{r}
summary(dtframe)

```

### 8.	Display the column names of the survey data frame

```{r}
names(dtframe)
```

### 9.	Retrieve the top 3 rows from the data frame.

```{r}
head(dtframe,3)
```

### 10.	Extract the bottom 2 rows from the data frame.

```{r}
tail(dtframe,2)
```

## R Markdown

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
